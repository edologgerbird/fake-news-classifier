# fake-news-clustering
 
 ## Steps:
 1. EDA

 2. Data cleaning

    - Remove null text entries

3.  Data Preparation

    - Combining text columns
    - Hashing Vectorisation
    - TF-IDF Vectorisation

4. Kmeans Clustering (Hashing Vectorisation and IF-IDF Vectorisation)

    - First conudct unsupervised learning to check for potential inherent patterns within the data which discriminates fake and real data.
    - Using 2 clusters for fake and reliable news
    - Building the models
    - Model Performances

5. Passive Aggressive Classifier (Hashing Vectorisation and IF-IDF Vectorisation)

    - Building the models
    - Model Performaces

6. Logistic Regression (Hashing Vectorisation and IF-IDF Vectorisation)

    - Building the models
    - Model Performaces

7. RandomForest Regression (Hashing Vectorisation and IF-IDF Vectorisation)

    - Building the models
    - Model Performances

8. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) (Hashing Vectorisation and IF-IDF Vectorisation)

    - Building the models
    - Model Performaces

9. Best Model for Fake News Classification
